uw_corridors (former railcorridors)
===================================

Original work by Joz, rewritten by orwell. 
Changed the materials, modified the method of creating corridors (so that it generates fences), and introduced VoxelManip.

This mod adds some bridge/fortress-like constructions into the Underworld caves uw_subterrain generates.

License is WTFPL. You just do what the fuck you want to.
