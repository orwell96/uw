This mod adds an underworld at below -5000 to -8000, featuring large caves from paramat's subterrain, rack and portals(improved by me) from PilzAdam and some 'fortresses' which have been derived from Joz's railcorridors.

The different readme's contain information about the different parts this mod is made of.

uw: Mod for Minetest 0.4.13 (former 'nether' by PilzAdam)

This is a rewrite of PilzAdam's nether mod:
- small portal logic improvements
- spawning lava sources on the bottom of the caves from uw_subterrain
